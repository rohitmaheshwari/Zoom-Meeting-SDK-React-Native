# Zoom Meeting SDK for React Native

## Installation

In your React Native project, install the Meeting SDK:

`$ npm install @zoom/meetingsdk-react-native --save`

In the iOS and Android folders in your project, you will also need to [install the iOS and Android Zoom Meeting SDKs](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/meeting-sdk/react-native/), respectively.

## Usage

In the component file where you want to use the Meeting SDK, import `ZoomSDKProvider` and `useZoom`.

```js
import { ZoomSDKProvider, useZoom } from '@zoom/meetingsdk-react-native';
```

Wrap your application with `ZoomSDKProvider` and set the required configuration properties.

```js
{...}
return (
  <ZoomSDKProvider
    config={{
    jwtToken: '{Your Zoom JWT Token}',
    domain: 'zoom.us',
    enableLog: true,
    logSize: 5,
  }}>
    <RestOfTheApp />
  </ZoomSDKProvider>
)
```

Get the Meeting SDK instance.

```js
const zoom = useZoom();
```

Generate an [SDK JWT Token](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/meeting-sdk/auth/).

Then, join a meeting.

```js
await zoom.joinMeeting({
  userName: displayName,
  meetingNumber: meetingNumber,
  password: meetingPassword,
});
```
